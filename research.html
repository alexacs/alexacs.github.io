 <br> &nbsp;(with <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~ccameron/">Charles Cameron</a>)</p> 



      <!-- <p> -->
      <!-- 	      What effect does regulatory auditing by OIRA have on the production of regulations in the agencies? In particular, does targeting an agency for heavy regulatory auditing inhibit its production of regulations, a "chilling" effect?  Does heavy auditing encourage it to substitute multiple small regulations in place of single large one, "OIRA avoidance"? We present an early empirical analysis of these questions by estimating regulation production functions for federal agencies, using data from the Unified Agenda from 1995 to 2010. We attempt to distinguish the differential effects of regulatory auditing from appointments into the agencies, leveraging off exogenous variation created by independent regulatory commissions.  Our data uncover no evidence of a chilling effect in the production of economically significant regulations due to the Bush Administration's regulatory auditing, relative to the Clinton or early Obama Administrations. Nor do we find any evidence of OIRA avoidance. We do find some evidence that the Bush Administration reduced the production of non-economically significant regulations overall. However, the effect appears to be due to appointments in the agencies. Overall, the results raise questions about the efficacy of presidential efforts to control the regulatory state, and how best to evaluate those efforts.</font></p> -->

 <p>"Regulating Under the Shadow of Centralized Review: Political Oversight and Deterrence Effects"
 <br> &nbsp; (job market paper, available on request)
 <br>
&nbsp; <a onclick ="javascript:ShowHide('deterrence')" href="javascript:;">view abstract</a>
<div class = "mid" style="display:none" id="deterrence">
In response to the growth of the administrative state, presidents have developed a system of centralized review to selectively audit regulatory actions for political scrutiny. How does centralized review make agencies more responsive to presidential priorities? Clearly centralized review allows presidents to single out non-compliant regulations for revision or termination. More consequential, however, might be how centralized review shapes agency behavior in anticipation of an audit---the deterrence effect. In this paper, I develop a simple theory to show how the threat of auditing should induce agencies to invest in accommodating presidential preferences, regardless of whether a particular regulatory action is eventually audited. Across nearly two hundred regulatory agencies and three presidential administrations, I show how patterns of targeting and deterrence have moved in unison, demonstrating the pervasive influence of centralized review in holding agencies accountable to presidential priorities.</div>

<p><a href="implement.pdf">"Which Statute to Implement? Strategic Timing by Regulatory Agencies"</a>
<br> &nbsp; (under review)
 <br>
&nbsp; <a onclick ="javascript:ShowHide('imp')" href="javascript:;">view abstract</a>
<div class = "mid" style="display:none" id="imp">
A critical though underexplored decision that regulatory agencies make is their choice of which statutes to implement as they set their regulatory agenda. In a standard positivist framework, strategic agencies should be expected to implement statutes of varying partisan origins in order to satisfy the ideological preferences of their political principals---conservative principals, for example, may prefer regulation that implements statutes passed by conservative coalitions. In this paper, I demonstrate that regulatory agencies can choose different statutes to prioritize and I present empirical evidence that this choice changes with party control of political institutions. The use of statutory deadlines by enacting coalitions to insulate agencies from such politically motivated implementation schedules does not alter the empirical patterns.

<p>"Uncovering Partisan Bias toward Regulators: A Methodological Framework and an Application to Agency Politicization"
<br> &nbsp; (available on request)
 <br>
&nbsp; <a onclick ="javascript:ShowHide('bias')" href="javascript:;">view abstract</a>
<div class = "mid" style="display:none" id="bias">
I use a behavioral model of strategic auditing between a president and an agency to motivate a statistical methodology that uncovers the degree to which presidents exhibit a bias toward reviewing, or auditing, policy proposals from regulatory agencies. The behavioral model suggests that auditing patterns should reveal the degree of preference divergence between presidents and agencies: proposals from "adversaries" are audited more frequently than proposals from "allies." Using insights from the model, I statistically estimate the auditing bias president's have toward individual agencies. I estimate a partisan bias that changes depending on the party of the president, as well as a shared bias exhibited by presidents of both parties. I use the estimates of partisan bias to show that the dimension of partisan conflict in regulatory policymaking is shaped by a Republican bias toward auditing health, safety and environmental agencies and a Democratic bias toward auditing agencies with close ties to industry. I also compare my estimates of partisan bias to existing measures of agency ideology and find positive, albeit modest, correlations. </div> </p>


  <p><a href="oira_aug14.pdf">"Regulatory Auditing at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs"</a> (with <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~ccameron/">Charles Cameron</a>)
   <br>
&nbsp; <a onclick ="javascript:ShowHide('oira')" href="javascript:;">view abstract</a>
<div class = "mid" style="display:none" id="oira">
The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) is the locus for centralized presidential efforts to control agency rulemaking, predominately through the process of selectively auditing and then ordering the revision of regulatory proposals. We begin by modeling OIRA's targeting decisions, analyzing two distinctly different models.  Our first approach centers the ideological conflict in rulemaking between conservative under-regulators and liberal over-regulators. Under this framework, Republican administrations target large proposals from overzealous liberal agencies and Democratic administrations focus on scaling up modest proposals from conservative agencies.  Our second approach reorients the ideological conflict to the familiar spatial model, whereby OIRA is used to limit policy damage from ideologically distant agencies by scaling down their more ambitious proposals. To test our theoretical predictions, we conducted the first systematic analysis of OIRA's targeting decision, using data across three presidential administrations and over 30 regulatory agencies. Our analysis reveals that Republican OIRAs disproportionately targeted large proposals from liberal agencies, a finding compatible with both theoretical models. Democratic OIRAs, on the other hand, did not disproportionately audit conservative agencies, either by targeting under-regulation (per our extension) or the more ambitious proposals (per the baseline model). Rather, they targeted large regulations with apparent disregard for ideology. We speculate what objective (if any) might lead Democratic administrations to rationally employ such a regulatory auditing strategy.</div>

<h3>Works in Progress</h3>


<!-- The second project focuses on public school teachers, who are both bureaucrats and occasional political actors, and analyzes the extent to which teacher lobbying has stymied the growth of charter school enrollment across school districts. My research design is centered around exploiting variation in state charter law that specifies whether new charter applications must receive school district approval to start a school, or whether applicants can instead apply to state level agencies. Among other results, I find evidence that charter enrollment is lower in states that require new applicants to seek approval at the local school district, as opposed to a state-level agency. To the extent that many teachers oppose the expansion of charter school enrollment, this finding is consistent with a theory that teachers and unions may have more influence over locally elected school boards than at the state-level where, among other factors, the diversity of constituency pressures may overshadow the influence of any one pressure group. -->

  <p>"Make or Delegate: A Theory of Delegation to Lawmaking Agencies"
   <br>
&nbsp; <a onclick ="javascript:ShowHide('del')" href="javascript:;">view abstract</a>
<div class = "mid" style="display:none" id="del">

     
Why are statutes that delegate lawmaking authority to federal agencies typically passed by near-majority coalitions with the support of the president? More specifically, why does this pattern hold for policy areas that tend to evoke partisan discord? In this paper, I present a new theory of delegation that is derived from vote-buying models of legislative behavior in order to highlight the incentives that lawmakers have to cede lawmaking authority to agencies. The theory presents delegation as a means of creating a market for agency oversight activities, which allows politicians to capture more rents from interest groups. The theory is distinct from the two dominant, though not mutually incompatible, explanations in the literature for why elected officials delegate policymaking authority to unelected bureaucrats: policy insulation and expertise. The goal of the paper is not to invalidad these theories, but rather to provide a richer menu of theoretical possibilities from which to explain delegation, particularly in the context of agency lawmaking (rulemaking). Critically, the model highlights the tension between the legislature and executive over the control of interest group rents and, relatedly, provides predictions about whether delegation should transfer policymaking authority to an independent agency or an executive branch agency. </div></p>

<p>"When Agents Elect their Principals: Evidence of Elite Capture from the Charter School Movement"
 <br>
&nbsp; <a onclick ="javascript:ShowHide('charter')" href="javascript:;">view abstract</a>
<div class = "mid" style="display:none" id="charter">
  Recent scholarship has identified the disproportionate influence that teacher unions have in school board elections, and highlighted that unions can effectively choose their political overseers. In this paper, I analyze the extent of teacher influence over school board policymaking by looking at the growth of charter school enrollment across districts. My research design is centered around exploiting variation in state charter law that specifies whether new charter applications must receive school district approval to start a school, or whether applicants can instead apply to state level agencies. Among other results, I find evidence that charter enrollment is lower in states that require new applicants to seek approval at the local school district, as opposed to a state-level agency. To the extent that many teachers oppose the expansion of charter school enrollment, this finding is consistent with a theory that teachers and unions may have more influence over locally elected school boards than at the state-level where, among other factors, the diversity of constituency pressures may overshadow the influence of any one pressure group.
